Missing Number
In this coding challenge you will implement the function whoIsMissing with the signature

int whoIsMissing(const std::vector& nums);
It is guaranteed that when the input vector nums is of size n, it contains all of the integers 0, 1, 2, ..., n except for one.  The goal of the whoIsMissing function is to return the missing number.

Example 1: nums = {1} Here nums is of size 1 and out of 0, 1 it is missing 0.  The function should return 0.

Example 2: nums = {2, 3, 0, 4} Here nums is of size 4 and out of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 it is missing 1.  The function should return 1.

Example 3: nums = {0, 2, 4, 1, 3} Here nums is of size 5 and out of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 it is missing 5.  The function should return 5.

Implement the whoIsMissing function in the file missing.cpp.  As usual, main.cpp is provided for you to test your implementation.  We provide some test cases in main.cpp to get you started and you are free to write additional test cases or modify main.cpp as you see fit.  The marker will only make use of the files missing.cpp and missing.hpp.  The marker will run additional tests on your code besides those provided in main.cpp.  Please do not alter the missing.hpp file.  You can include any additional libraries you want to use in missing.cpp (or main.cpp).
